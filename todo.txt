- the nature of the game will be one of presenting the player with different modes - waves first, then objectives
- less space invaders and more gravitar and open battlefields 
- modularity in each ship's design
- randomization of design will be possible as well as uniformity for factions
- human can shoose ship to control 

------------------------------------------


- grey bar

- differentiate between explosions of ships and lasers' hits on ships (small, big)
- add limit to speed so it doesn't loop back the other way
- function to make the circle types will take the Ship and 2 aarguments to pass to the inner function that actually makes the movement happen for the enum.


BEHAVIOR:

While ship is is IDLE action state, it is trying to decide what to do next, mostly random behavior and avoiding the edges of the map, or maybe staying in a  certain locality.  From IDLE it can move to a number of random sub movements determined by a random number everytime the counter reaches 0 again. An enemy or other prompt will wakeup the ship to do something else.

CHANGE:  IDLE will mean more like stopped, barely moving, and there will be another status called READY that will act as a neutral in between state while determining next behavior.  Ready will search for next targets or movements needed. 


- remove little guns from ship sprites
- add more sprites: med and capital ships, purple and teal
- change colors, mskr modular with color wheel
- make vsync editable
CURRENT: MAKE MENU IN GAME
- make smaller laser explosion, different explosions by rand


center of camera - half screenwidth + half y height
- make camera zoomable but no select menu when playercontrol is true
