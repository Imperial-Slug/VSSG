- the nature of the game will be one of presenting the player with different modes - waves first, then objectives
- less space invaders and more gravitar and open battlefields 
- modularity in each ship's design
- randomization of design will be possible as well as uniformity for factions
- human can shoose ship to control 

------------------------------------------

We will keep the autospawn ship as the human controlled ship for now.

FIrst, we need to make the AI class, and seperate it from the human one. 

Make the mouseclick spawnShip() method spawn not a human controlled ship but rather a computer controlled ship. This will be sufficient for testing while basic AI behavior is figured out. This may nee extensive planning before programming is started.

1) MAke the Ship object into a CpuShip or PlayerShip in the appropriate methods DONE

2) Make separate ObjectSet lists with the appropriate type.  Make sure Ships of the right types are added to these at the appropriate times. DONE

3)  The CpuShips will have an ActionQeue list of Action objects that can hold and define an action to be performed and actions to perform after one another

- lookup: optimal starting res

- - escape quits
- grey bar
- hitboxes
- make ship dissapear on laser hit
- make explosion animations
- each Ship needs its own action counter to keep track of how long it has been doing an action for control purposes
- differentiate between explosions of ships and lasers' hits on ships (small, big)
- add limit to speed so it doesn't loop back the other way
