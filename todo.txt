- less space invaders and more gravitar and open battlefields 
- modularity in each ship's design
- randomization of design will be possible as well as uniformity for factions
- human can shoose ship to control

- grey bar

- differentiate between explosions of ships and lasers' hits on ships (small, big)
- add limit to speed so it doesn't loop back the other way
- function to make the circle types will take the Ship and 2 aarguments to pass to the inner function that actually makes the movement happen for the enum.
