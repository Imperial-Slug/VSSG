- the nature of the game will be one of presenting the player with different modes - waves first, then objectives
- less space invaders and more gravitar and open battlefields 
- modularity in each ship's design
- randomization of design will be possible as well as uniformity for factions
- human can shoose ship to control 

------------------------------------------

We will keep the autospawn ship as the human controlled ship for now.

FIrst, we need to make the AI class, and seperate it from the human one. 

Make the mouseclick spawnShip() method spawn not a human controlled ship but rather a computer controlled ship. This will be sufficient for testing while basic AI behavior is figured out. This may nee extensive planning before programming is started.
